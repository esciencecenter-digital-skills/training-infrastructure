### First email to participants
#### Subject: `r params$workshop`: Setup instructions & venue details

Hello,

We are excited for the `r params$workshop` workshop on `r params$date`, and hope you are too. 

**This workshop will be delivered in person, unless new COVID-19 restrictions are put in place.*** The workshop will take place at `r params$location`. 

A few notes:

Be sure to complete this (pre-workshop survey)[pre-workshop survey] [1] by midday tomorrow. We use this to calibrate the pace of the workshop and, together with a post-workshop survey, to assess how it went.

You need to bring your own laptop to the workshop. Make sure you have the necessary software installed on your laptop by following the `r params$setup_instructions` [2]. If you have any trouble following the instructions, send us an email.

On the workshop days (`r params$date`), please arrive at the venue at least 15 minutes before the start of the workshop (`r params$start_time`), if possible. That will allow us to start teaching on time. One of our helpers will welcome you at the entrance of the venue and show you to the classroom. Directions to the venue can be found here [3].

During the workshop, the eScience Center will provide lunch. At the end of the workshop, we will provide drinks and an opportunity to network with other course participants, instructors and helpers.

If you won’t be able to attend, please cancel your registration (by following instructions here [4]) so that we can offer your seat to someone on the waiting list.

Make sure to keep the `r params$workshop_website` [5] with all the necessary details handy.  

Let us know if you have any questions by emailing training@esciencecenter.nl. Otherwise, we will see you on `r params$day_of_workshop` from `r params$start_time`! 

Looking forward to seeing you soon!

On behalf of the eScience Center Training Team,

Sacha van Breugel
